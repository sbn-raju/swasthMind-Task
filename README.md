# ALL THE TASK IN THIS REPO
Requirements:-
<hr>
 -Setup a PostgreSQL database with a sample schema that includes at least one table.
- Develop API endpoints using Node.js and Express.js framework to perform CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database.<br><br><br>
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints. Only authenticated users should be able to access the CRUD operations. Use token-based authentication (JWT) or session-based authentication as per your preference.<br><br><br>
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).<br><br><br>
- Ensure that sensitive data such as passwords and access tokens are securely stored and transmitted using encryption (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing, HTTPS for secure communication).<br><br><br>
- Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).<br><br><br>
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.<br><br><br>
- Document your code adequately, including API documentation and instructions for setting up the development environment and running the application.<br><br><br>
